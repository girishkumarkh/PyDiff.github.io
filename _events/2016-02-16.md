# Thomas Campbell - Using Python for National Cipher Challenge 2015

[The National Cipher Challenge](http://www.cipher.maths.soton.ac.uk/) is run by The University of Southampton every year and invites students to break ciphers of varying difficulty, from simple Caesar ciphers to Enigma and beyond. In this talk, I'll describe how I used python to tackle the 2015 challenge and demonstrate some of the code I used in doing so.

# Will Webberley - Creating 'Patients, Please' at NHS Hack Day 2016

A group of PyDiffers recently attended the NHS Hack Day in Cardiff and created a small game called 'Patients, Please', which is inspired by the game [Papers, Please](http://papersplea.se). Whilst the front-end was written using Unity, the back-end game logic was provided through a simple Python API. I'll give an overview of the game and our approach.
