# Venue Change!

This months PyDiff is being held just down the road from its usual home in Maths at the School of Computer Science & Informatics. We'll be in Lecture Theatre T/2.09, on the second floor of the Trevithick building. To find us, go through the main doors of Trevithick, then take the stairs or lift ahead of you to the second floor. See you there!

# Matt J. Williams â€“ Mining Github and Meetup.com to Explore the UK's Digital Tech Clusters

What can Github and Meetup.com tell us about the UK's digital tech clusters? In this talk I will describe how Python was used to mine these online platforms to compare programming expertise and tech communities in different regions of the UK. These data contributed to the recently launched [Tech Nation 2016](http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/tech-nation-2016) report, which provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the UK's digital tech clusters.

# Robert Dragan - The Learnium Tech Stack

[Learnium](https://learnium.com) is a Cardiff based company that has built a social learning network on top of Python and Django. Robert is the CEO of the company and will share his experience with Python and a bunch of other tool and frameworks used at Learnium.
