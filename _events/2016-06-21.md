# Martin Jones - Using evolution to win the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma game

The Prisoners Dilemma is the best known example of a game that can be explained using game theory, and the iterated version has been a platform for exploring different strategies. 
In this talk I'll describe a couple of approaches that have recently been used to generate novel strategies which score more highly than previous ones. 
The talk will be based on the [Axelrod Python library](http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
