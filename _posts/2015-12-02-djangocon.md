[DjangoCon Europe 2016](http://2016.djangocon.eu) will be held in Budapest, 30th March to 3rd April.

Speaking at a DjangoCon is a great experience: you'll find a friendly and interested audience, and
you're pretty much guaranteed to discover a lot of people who are very keen to talk some more
about what you have to say.

This might seem like a big step if you've never addressed a conference before, but the DjangoCon
Europe [call for proposals](https://2016.djangocon.eu/cfp/) explicitly encourages and invites new
speakers to submit talks. In other words, if you've never spoken at a DjangoCon or similar event
before, they want you - *yes, you* - **yes, *you***, the one saying "who, me?" - to submit a talk.

This isn't just an idle invitation. It's being backed up by a *speaker mentor programme*, to help
put you in touch with an experienced speaker who will be delighted to help you prepare your
proposal and practise your talk - take advantage of it!

Still, **there's nothing like practising your talk before a small audience**, so to help, PyDiff
will offer you just that.

If you think you'd like to submit a DjangoCon proposal, get in touch with us. We can help you with
it if you like, but what we'll also do is arrange a special PyDiff meetup where you - most likely
along with a couple of other potential DjangoCon speakers - can **road-test your talk** and get
some **friendly feedback** before you take on the big stage in Budapest.

Just drop us a line via the usual channels if you're interested. The Call for Papers deadline is
the 14th January, but **we'd love to be the guinea pigs for your talk** any time between now and
DjangoCon.
